# iOS-HowManyFingers
A simple "hello world" app that let's you guess how many fingers the iPhone is holding behind it's back. 

First program I've created for iOS, written in Swift 2/xcode 7.

App loads and asks you how many fingers the phone is holding up, if you're correct it tells you, if you're not, try again!
